# remote-edf2asc

A utility to remotely yank EDFs from an EyeLink Host PC and convert them to plain-text ASCII (ASC) on the fly.

**shoutout to [@alicexue][https://github.com/alicexue] for the inspiration and for convincing me that rebooting the EyeLink Host PC to the Windows partition and plugging in a flash drive was not necessary**
